UBports Raspberry Pi Focus Group. Join the discussion on [our forum](https://forums.ubports.com/category/43/ut-for-raspberry-pi) and our [Telegram focus group](https://t.me/UBports_pi).

## Goals
### Desktop
* Have Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity8 running on a Raspberry Pi
* Provide easy install method (usally by providing an ready-to-use image)
### Phone
* Have Ubuntu Touch running on a Raspberry Pi with at least a Touch Screen
* Enable the use of additional phone hardware (TouchScreen, Battery, Modem, other
Sensors)
* Make every UT core app/component and OpenStore work on a Raspberry Pi
* Provide an easy install method
* Provide updates
## Benefits
* Non-Android-Architecture
  * Synergy effect with Librem 5 (booting and updates without fastboot/recovery)
  * Possible Standardization of Android-Free-UT, like Rootfs could become a blueprint for
Non-Android-Phones
* Development board for Ubuntu Touch
  * Enables enthusiasts to build there own phones with Ubuntu Touch (these people are in
the telegram group already)
  * Enables App developers to develop on a real arm Ubuntu Touch device
* Unity8 desktop side
  * Developing and testing towards convergence (HDMI, USB, Bluetooth)
* Community
  * The Raspberry Pi community is huge and full of enthusiasts
  * The UBports Raspberry Pi project could attract developers and power users to Ubuntu
Touch
  * Raspberry is widely used in education, there could be cooperations with initiatives, e.g.
where students learn what a smartphone consists of or even build there own phones
## Conceptional questions
* How to boot Ubuntu Touch on a non-Android-Device?
* How to install OTA-Updates on a non-Android-Device?
* How to enable the use of different hardware?
* Partition layout?
* What are exact differences between Ubuntu and Ubuntu Touch? Which are just needed for
Android-devices and which are by design?
* What needs to be adapted in Ubuntu Touch to make it work with a Raspberry Pi?
* How to handle the different Raspberry Pi Models?
* How does the variable size of SD cards in a Raspberry Pi affect installation and update
concept?
## Team
* @jonny aka Jonatan Hatakeyama Zeidler (Moderator, Developer)
* @Stereofont aka Lionelb (Moderator)
* @Stason888 aka Seven (Moderator, Developer, is already building his own Raspy-Phone)
* Many members in the telegram focus group
  * many of them seem to have Raspberry Pis
  * some already share ideas on the concept
  * we have no idea yet, who is going to really contribute
